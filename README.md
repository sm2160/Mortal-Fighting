**Mortal Fighting Game**

**Overview**


The "Mortal Fighting" project is an exciting endeavor aimed at coding a 2D fighting game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by classic arcade-style fighting games, this project focuses on implementing basic fighting game mechanics while gradually evolving the gameplay experience through sprite-based animations, interactive interfaces, and dynamic elements.

**Key Features**

Basic Fighting Mechanics: The project begins with the implementation of fundamental fighting game mechanics, allowing players to control rectangular characters with simple attack and movement capabilities.
Sprite Animation: As the project progresses, rectangular characters are transformed into dynamic sprites with fluid animations, including idle, running, jumping, attacking, and taking damage sequences.
Interactive Backgrounds: In addition to character sprites, animated backgrounds are introduced to enhance the visual appeal and immersion of the game environment.
User Interface Design: The game features a polished user interface (UI) with elements such as health bars, game timers, and textual displays, providing players with essential information and feedback during gameplay.
Deployment: Upon completion, the game is prepared for deployment on Brighton Domains, making it accessible to a wider audience for playtesting and feedback.
Development Roadmap
Project Setup: Initialize the project folder structure and set up the necessary files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.
Character Creation: Create player and enemy characters using basic shapes (rectangles) and define their initial attributes and behaviors.
Character Movement: Implement event listeners to enable player control for character movement, including horizontal navigation and jumping.
Combat Mechanics: Introduce attack functionality, allowing characters to engage in combat by detecting collisions and triggering attack animations.
Health Bar Interface: Design and integrate health bars for player and enemy characters, updating dynamically based on combat interactions and damage taken.
Game Timers and Game Over: Implement game timers to track the duration of each match and determine the game's outcome, signaling a game over condition upon completion.
